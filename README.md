This application consists exactly of changing a series of notes that you enter by clicking on the notes of the piano and then you choose the number of positive or negative semitones to which you want the notes that you previously entered to be transposed, that is, if you enter the note Do and transposes it to 2 semitones the resulting note is Re since from C to Re there are 2 semitones.
